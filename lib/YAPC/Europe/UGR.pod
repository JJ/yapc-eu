YAPC::Europe::UGR - University of Granada proposal for YAPC::EU 2014

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use YAPC::Europe::UGR;

    use const YAPC::Europe::2013::venue => UGR;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

 This module describes the bid by the L<Free Software Office at the
 University of Granada |http://osl.ugr.es> aided by Barcelona.pm and
 Madrid.pm to host YAPC::EU 2014.  

=head2  University of Granada proposal for YAPC::EU 2014

The Free Software Office at the
L<University of Granada|http://www.ugr.es>,
with the support of Madrid.pm and
Barcelona.pm presents this bid for YAPC::EU 2014.

=head3 Organizers

The L<OSL (Free Software Office)|http://osl.ugr.es> is led by
L<JJ Merelo|http://search.cpan.org/~jmerelo/>, with a longtime Perl
experience, founder of the mainly course-oriented Granada.pm (which
organizes virtual courses of L<basic Perl|http://cevug.ugr.es/perl>
and L<intermediate Perl|http://cevug.ugr.es/perl_avanzado> with a
long history and more than a dozen editions. Merelo has attended, and
made presentations, at the YAPC::EU 2002 and 2009 conferences, and
also attended and presented a paper at the 2013 FOSDEM Perl devroom.

The OSL will have the support of the two strongest Perl Mongers group
in the Spanish state, Madrid.pm and Barcelona.pm, who will help with
anything that is not quintessentially local.

The key persons of the proposal would be:

=over 4

=item *

JJ Merelo, with experience organizing other events such as PPSN
2002 and ECAL 1995, in the evolutionary algorithm area. Also
collaboration with other conferences such as CEC 2011 or EvoStar, and
many events by the OSL, such as NotBarraLibreCamp

=item *

Antonio Mora was the local organizer for the L<Computational
    Inteligence in Games conference|
    http://geneura.ugr.es/cig2012/accommodation.html> and is currently
    a postdoc at the university of Granada. 

=item *

Members of the Madrid.pm and Barcelona.pm

=item *

Volunteers and other people attached to the
L<OSL|http://osl.ugr.es/about/quienes-somos/>

=item *

Additional help from the
L<IT delegation of the university of Granada|http://detic.ugr.es>
and L<Computer Science School|http://etsiit.ugr.es>

=back

=head3 Contact

We will setup an address @ugr.es, but for the time being the contact
will be L<dirosl@ugr.es> (direction of the Free Software office)

=head2 Venue

We will hold it at the most convenient place at the
L<University of Granada|http://www.ugr.es>,
with campus all over the city of Granada
(Spain). Granada includes such beauties as the Alhambra and the most
beautiful grafittis of all the country.

We have pre-acceptance for holding it at the
L<ETSIIT|http://etsiit.ugr.es> Computer Science School, which is
in the outskirts of the city but has all the facilities needed for
a multi-room conference and is, anyways, well communicated with
the rest of the city.

Granada is linked to Madrid, London and Barcelona by regular daily and
frequent flights and also to Mallorca and to other places (but flight
frequencies vary often). ME<aacute>laga is one hour away by car or 2 hours by
bus and is linked to all major European cities. There are buses and
trains to Madrid and Seville, but coach is always the best option
outside the plane.

The ETSIIT is linked to the city center (with many lodging options) by
several buses. Depending on the date, student residences might also be
available (July is the best date for that, since usual guests will be
on holiday).


=head3 Catering

The school has a relatively large cafeteria and a university canteen,
which can accommodate a good amount of hungry students. There are 250
sitting places, but buffer-style eating with sitting space outside the
cafeteria, including common areas and classes, can also be
arranged. The school cafeteria can provide the food itself for a good
price (from 17E<euro> a sitting, served menu to less if it's standing around
tables).

Cheap beer-and tapas can be had around the school for 2E<euro> beer + tapa
of choice, for  beers (or non-alcoholic drinks) are enough for any hungry
monger.

=head2 Conference Details

It's going to be, AFAIK, the YAPC::EU southernmost conference, so this fact will have to be taken into account in the details of the conference... not. 

=head3 Dates

Due to budgetary reasons, the university is locked during August;
closest we can make it is late July or early September. Late July has
the advantage of empty classrooms with no problem to schedule the
conference, while early September would be a little more problematic
(but no big deal for a 2 or 3 day conference), milder weather (but you
can still go to the beach) and good choice of accommodations (lower
touristic season, if there's such a thing in Granada).

=head3 Theme

We propose I<The art of Perl> as a theme for this conference. Perl
poetry has been all but forgotten, and, besides, the Fine Arts school
is close to the Computer Science school, so we might even attract some
of those free spirits to our conference.

=head2 Website

We will host it at the OSL servers, using Act! or other Perl toolkit
for creating websites. No PHP. I promise.

=head2 Auction

I remember keenly the promotion at YAPC 2002 where stuff like
optimization of opcodes was offered. We plan to offer that in Granada,
maybe including being painted by a local grafitti artist, a trip
through Granada tunnels, or a tapas crawl through local watering
holes with local experts (hard to find, really).

We'll also look for Perl gurus memorabilia, camel hair underpants, and
onion jam. Or suchlike.

=head2 Promotion

The OSL maintains a presence in social networks (identi.ca, Twitter,
Facebook), and the people in the organization do have that too.
We would use email, local free software events (the Libre
Software World Conference is held yearly in Fall somewhere in
Spain), FOSDEM devrooms, and a sandwich man walking around
inconspicuously around PHP and Python developer conferences.

=head2 Survey

We are developing an app for creating a personal schedule, and as in
past conferences, we'll use whatever people have scheduled
for creating a preference. Which will be probably for those
dressed as Star Trek fleet ensigns or anything that is not
simultaneous to talks by Damian, brian or Mark.

=head2 Additional Program

Granada offers a great amount of options for people from 2 to
22. Sorry, to 222. We'll organize a tapas crawl in the
best watering holes of Granada, artistic trips through the
grafitti art in Granada streets. And, yes, also Alhambra
and all those things. We'll also organize courses for those
interested and beginning courses in Spanish.

=head3 Courses

No innovation here. We'll provide space during or preferably before
the conference so that people that want to give tutorial or
courses can pay trip expenses giving them. The organization
will only collect a racket, sorry, a cut for, you know,
protection.

For a boost of visibility (or outing) of the Spanish Perl community,
we'll also provide courses in several levels in Spanish. Any
other languages can also be arranged.

=head3 Side Trips

Anything can be arranged; we will contact a travel agency so that they
can offer packages for a good price. But the usual thing is:

=over 4

=item *

Alhambra and Generalife.

=item *

Sunset in front of the Alhambra, through the world heritage quarter
called Generalife.

=item *

Renaissance in Granada: cathedral and other churches and palaces.

=item *

Tapas crawl including fried fish, meat and everything you can include
in a little dish.

=back

=head2 Budget

Now we're talking business. We will stick to the same registration costs as the
last conference. Venue is free, since it's organized as an
institutional (meaning university, as belonging to the
University of Granada) event. This will leave us some
leeway to give a better attendees dinner.

We are talking of a ballpark of 10K E<euro>. We will also apply to local
science funding agencies and the university to defray part of the
cost. The Free Software Office will absorb any deficit (or, for
that matter, surplus) if there is one.

=head3 Income

Main income will be levied on attendees. Planned attendance fees are
							      in the
							      same
							      ballpark
							      as
							      previous
							      events:
=over 4
=item Guests, Speakers, Organizers : 0 EUR
=item Full-time students: 50 EUR
=item Early-bird: 80 EUR
=item Regular price: 110 EUR
=item Corporate tariff:
900 EUR
=back

Final fees have to be announced. We will request any amount from sponsors, and past events have
							      gathered
							      around
							      6000EUR
							      just
							      from
							      local
							      sponsors. A
							      minimum
							      of
							      1000EUR
							      can be
							      expected
							      from
							      those
							      sources.

=head3 Costs

There are several costs per attendee:
=over 4
=item T-shirt: 4.5 EUR
=item Catering: 35 EUR 
=item Bag: 4 EUR
=item badge, and other stuff: 2EUR
=item Attendees dinner: 30EUR
=back

This is around 75EUR per attendee, fully covered by early-bird fee and
							      with a
							      deficit
							      for
							      speakers
							      and
							      students. This
							      will be
							      compensated
							      with the
							      surplus
							      provided
							      by late
							      arrivals
							      and
							      sponsors. 

The budget will be adjusted mainly by providing less or more
							      lunches
							      or
							      adding a
							      coffee
							      break. 

In this scenario the only fixed cost is covering the costs of the 75
							      speakers
							      which is
							      5625
							      EUR. Realistically,
							      that
							      cost can
							      be
							      covered
							      only by
							      sponsorships. 

If we add the cost of one or two invited speakers at around 2000EUR
							      per
							      speaker,
							      there is
							      a
							      deficit
							      of 9625
							      EUR . If
							      sponsorships
							      are not
							      reached
							      (or
							      corporate-fee
							      paying,
							      which
							      it's not
							      clear
							      how many
							      are
							      there)
							      lunches
							      would be
							      eliminated,
							      allowing
							      us to
							      basically
							      have
							      every
							      paying
							      person
							      cover
							      the cost
							      of a
							      single
							      speaker. We
							      would
							      need as
							      few as
							      75
							      attendees
							      to cover
							      the 75
							      speakers. 


 
=head2 Sponsors

Granada is being pushed as a technological city by consortiums such as
L<On Granada Tech City|http://www.ongranada.com/>
which is supported by major technological companies and
local institutions.

We have contact with local tech companies will will be willing to help
with small amounts; we will have no minimum requirement for
sponsorship. Companies such as L<Codeko.com|http://codeko.com>
or L<Blulabs|http://blulabs.es> have supported OSL events in the
past. We will mainly look for direct support of tchochkes such
as t-shirts or bags.

Support will also be requested from institutions of all kinds. Being
the economy of Spain in the shape that it is, we don't
expect much from that, but we will do it anyways and have
obtained support in the past.

=head2 About Granada

Granada is a student city which has been the preferred destination of
							     Erasmus
							     students
							     for a
							     long
							     time, and
							     that
							     accounts
							     for
							     something. It's
							     a lively
							     city with
							     many
							     services
							     for
							     visitors.

=head3 Getting here

Granada has an international airport, but easiest way is to transfer
							     at Madrid
							     or
							     Barcelona.

Some price for return tickets to Granada; these are for next September 2013.

=over 4

=item London: 246E<euro>
=item Paris: 227E<euro>
=item Rome: 271E<euro>
=item Frankfurt: 364E<euro>
=item Moscow: 505E<euro>
=item Vienna: 326E<euro>

=back

Most flights are in the 200-500 E<euro> range. 

There are many more options to Malaga, which is a big airport, including low-cost flights, but then you have to take a bus or train
							     to the
							     bus
							     station
							     and
							     another
							     bus (two
							     hours)
							     from
							     there. 

The local bus company provides also a direct bus to Granada from
							     Madrid
							     airport,
							     with two
							     frequencies
							     a day and
							     a low
							     price. Check
							     out the
							     L<ALSA|http://alsa.es>
							     site for
							     timetable. 

=head3 Sightseeing

Granada includes the Alhambra and Albayzin, an ensemble that has been
							      declared
							      world
							      heritage
							      site by
							      the
							      UNESCO. That
							      is only
							      part of
							      its
							      patrimony,
							      that
							      includes
							      also
							      Renaissance
							      palaces,
							      Gothic,
							      Renaissance
							      and
							      Baroque
							      churches,
							      and a
							      rather
							      unknown
							      but no
							      less
							      beautiful
							      set of
							      modernist
							      buildings.

Organized or self-organized options are available all year round. The
							      beach is
							      70 kms
							      and a
							      bus run
							      away. There
							      are also
							      many
							      opportunities
							      for
							      trekking
							      up in
							      Sierra
							      Nevada
							      or in
							      the
							      Alpujarras. 

=head2 Summary

=head2 Questions and Answers

=head3 What's the price of beer?

In the bars around the ETSIIT and in town, average price this year
(2013) is around 2E<euro>  and that includes the tapa, that is, a small dish
    with usually warm food. That's the price of a tubo (1/3
liter). It's not usual in Spain to have bigger portions; you just
    order a second one


=head3 What's the weather like in July/September?

It's definitely hot, with maximum that can go up to 40 degrees; it
goes down in September, but daily maximum are always over 30º.
September is milder, anyways.

=head3 Can people get receipts? 

Whether we choose a professional services company to organize
registration or the university itself, there's no problem with
    providing receipts. We will see what's the more convenient option
in term of work needed, but also financially; the University can
provide VAT-free registration while the external company can not.

=head3 How easy is it for people to navigate the city without speaking
Spanish?

If you have a good map and can orient yourself, it's pretty easy. In
    pure geographical terms, Granada is not a difficult place; on the
    other hand, the Spanish educational system has made sure that very
    few, if any, speak other than the mother tongue. However, they
    will speak loudly and kindly to you until they make themselves
    understood. 

=head3 It would be nice to have more details on accommodation, with a range of the prices that can be
expected for different levels of accommodation. Can most attendees fit in one hotel? Is
Internet access widely available in accommodations?

This is taken almost verbatim from L<CIG 2012
    site|http://geneura.ugr.es/cig2012/acommodation.html>, which
    Antonio Mora organized too. 

 Granada is a city accustomed to a large touristic inflow, so its offers a huge number of acommodation options for all budgets. In addition, due to the number of students living in the city (more than 60000 during the year), there are a big amount of visitors in these ages, so there are several economical lodgings.
So the city provides dozens of hotels ranging from 5-star to 1-star ones. It must be noted that hotels in Spain (and maybe more in Granada) are usually well priced due to the competition among them. Thus, a 4-star hotel may often be in the 75-100 E<euro> range and a 3-star hotel in the 50-75 E<euro> range.
Of course, some fluctuations can happen depending on the particular hotel and the zone where it is, but special packages are also possible, allowing more economic prices.

=head4 Recommended hotels (approximate prices)

=over 4

=item AC Palacio de Santa Paula - 5* (130E<euro> by night)
The best hotel in the city. Located at the main street (Gran VE<iacute>a) in the city centre. Well communicated to reach the ETSIIT.

=item Abba - 4* (75 E<euro> by night)
New hotel (less than 2 years old), close to the train station and near
    the city centre. Well placed to get to the ETSIIT (Avda
    ConstituciE<oacute>n). Usually has good offers for University events,
    including free WiFi and access to the spa,
    which we would arrange.

=item Vincci - 4* (80 E<euro> by night)
Well-considered hotel in the city, close to the train station and near the city centre. Well placed to get to the ETSIIT (Avda ConstituciE<oacute>n).

=item Granada Center - 4* (65 E<euro> by night)
Good hotel, not very expensive and close to a good tapas area (Severo Ochoa street, in front of the Faculty of Sciences).

=item Carmen - 4* (55 E<euro> by night)
Cheap hotel, but with good quality. It is near to the city centre.

=item Macia Gran Via - 3* (50 E<euro> by night)
In the main street and quite cheap.

=item Puerta de las Granadas - 3* (70 E<euro> by night)
Just below the Alhambra. Right in the most tourist area. Only 14 rooms.

=item Juan Miguel - 3* (45 E<euro> by night)
Cheap hotel in the city centre, close to the city hall.

=back

=head4 Student accommodation

As you can check, the prices are quite cheap even in four star hotels,
    but there are a L<huge amount of guest houses (Pensiones in
    Spanish) in the
    city|http://geneura.ugr.es/cig2012/brochures/guest_houses_granada.pdf>. Or
    if you prefer, there is a Youth hostel (Albergue in Spanish) in
    the city. During July, student dorms might offer also cheap
    accommodation; in September it's less likely. There are also two
    university residences, which are very nice, but not so
    conveniently located for accessing the ETSIIT. However, they might
    be used for invited speakers, mainly if we manage to pay them from
    university budget. 

=head3 Are there any plans to stream or record talks? If so, how will the recordings be made and
how will authorization be sought?

The assets are there, and it would be possible to record at least one
    of the tracks. That would be free for the conference, since the
    OSL is part of the IT dept of the university which includes the
    virtual department too. The ETSIIT includes also self-recording
    facilities in some classes, which we could use for some tracks.

=head3 Are any social events planned, other than the partner's program?

We plan to do a pre-conference drink-up and post-conference
    excursions. If sponsorship allows, we will organize a speakers'
    dinner the first conference day. 


=head3 Do you have any plans for an associated hackathon?

In the OSL we organize hackathons to the tune of several every year. We
    would love to organize one and try and attract local talent to
    Perl. Our experience says that it's better to organize them with
    at least one day and a half, which we would prefer to do before
    the conference. The venue could change, since we have contact with
    local coworking spaces that would provide the site and the
    connectivity, as well as in some cases free drinks and
    coffee. They can even be used overnight if needed. 


=head3 Do you plan to provide anything to speakers? (Such as water, a person to time things and
keep the schedule on track, etc)

We will have volunteers (students, GeNeura or OSL people) in every
    room to fix any problem that can arise, from lack of electrical
    outlets to swooning fans. Water will be provided for speakers, and
    they will be heartily patted in the back after they finish. The
    volunteer will also take care of time overruns by dancing a
    Spanish jitterbug when the speaker has spent his slot. 

=head3 How many tracks are planned?

Difficult to know in advance. Will depend on the number of
    papers. ETSIIT being a CS school, we can provide for up to 20
    tracks. Our YAPC::Eu experience dictates that there should be a
    part of the day with single track (we can call them keynotes) to
    prevent people giving a presentation at the same time than Damian
    or MJD to be delivering it to the bleachers.

=head3 How many days do you expect the event to run, and what days of the week are you
considering?

Wednesday until Friday, with Monday and Tuesday reserved for
    hackaton. Weekend for social events. 

=head3 What plans do you have concerning special diets for the coffee breaks (and lunch, if
sponsored)?

The ETSIIT can sponsor a single coffee break. Coffee breaks, however,
    are impersonal and there are excellent cafeterias around the
    ETSIIT which can give inexpensive and local fare such as garlic olive-oil
    toast, which no catering can provide and better quality coffee, as
    well as fresh orange juice. 

We will look for sponsors in any case, but will focus more on lunch
    and merchandising instead of coffee breaks. 

Any special needs will be catered for during lunch.


=head3 Please give more details about modern the venues are in terms of power plugs. Are there
many plugs in the rooms, or will you need to run extension cords? Are there places
outside of the rooms where people can charge equipment?
<<<<<<< HEAD

It's a CS and Telecommunications school, so there are enough power
    outlets in the corridors and cafeteria. Not so many in classrooms,
    but we will provide extension cords for all tracks. 

=head3 How accessible are the venues to people in wheelchairs, people with hearing difficulties, etc?

All rooms are accessible at the ETSIIT or any other UGR faculty,
    complying with Spanish law.

=head3 Will any wired connectivity be offered?

Only for speakers, and only if really needed. In principle, and
    according to IT services policies, just wireless connectivity will
    be provided. 

=head3 Please tell us more about the wireless network. How many people can it support? Is it part
of the venue, or will you set it up?

IT services provides an easy way to set up guest access, which is
    dimensioned for 1K students times two devices. You will not be
    able to operate a CPAN mirror off your laptop, but you should be
    OK for anything else. Besides, for anybody coming from an academic
    environment, EDUROAM works without a glitch.

=head3 Is it possible to have a cloakroom? Will there be a staffed
    help desk?

There is a storeroom belonging to the OSL in the ETSIIT, which we can
    use as a cloakroom and crash pad if needed. We will have a staffed
    help desk during the whole conference.


=head3 Are there projectors in all rooms?

Yes

=head3 Will there be provided interfacing connectors (for Macs, for
    example)?

No. The speaker will have to provide that.

=head3 Are microphones available for speakers?

Yes

=head3 We do plan to make your proposal public. Since it is a PDF document, could you please
remove any information you do not want included and send us a for publication copy of
the proposal?

It's been developed in GitHub, so everything is open from the get go. 


=head3 Are the rooms in your proposed venue flat or auditorium-style (or whatever you would use
in English to describe an ascending seating) If the rooms have different layouts, please
tell us which are of which type

We have both at the ETSIIT, but we intend to use those that are
    auditorium style (which, besides, are provided with air
    conditioning)


=head3 If lunch is not provided, please describe the possibilities for attendees to go out and find their own lunch

As indicated in the main proposal, the university cafeteria +
    dining room is able to accommodate 300 people
    simultaneously. Around the ETSIIT, you can eat at a bar just off
    the tapas (2E<euro> soda or beer + warm dish) or sandwiches or single
    combined plate for 3-4E<euro>. There's also a pizza parlor 500 meters
    away, and many different options further in the direction of
    downtown.
