    =head1 University of Granada proposal for YAPC::EU 2014


=head2  University of Granada proposal for YAPC::EU 2014

The Free Software Office at the L<University of
Granada|http://www.ugr.es>, with the support of Madrid.pm and
Barcelona.pm presents this bid for YAPC::EU 2014.

=head3 Organizers

 The L<OSL (Free Software Offfice)|http://osl.ugr.es> is led by L<JJ
 Merelo|http://search.cpan.org/~jmerelo/>, with a longtime Perl
 experience, founder of the mainly course-oriented Granada.pm (which
 organizes virtual courses of L<basic Perl|http://cevug.ugr.es/perl>
 and L<intermediate Perl| http://cevug.ugr.es/perl_avanzado> with a
 long history and more than a dozen editions. Merelo has attended, and
 made presentations, at the YAPC::EU 2002 and 2009 conferences, and
 also attended and presented a paper at the 2013 FOSDEM Perl Devroom.

 The OSL will have the support of the two strongest Perl Mongers group
 in the Spanish state, Madrid.pm and Barcelona.pm, who will help with
 anything that is not quintessentially local.

 The key persons of the proposal would be:

=over 1

=item JJ Merelo, with experience organizing other events such as PPSN
2002 and ECAL 1995, in the evolutionary algorithm area. Also
collaboration with other conferences such as CEC 2011 or EvoStar, and
many events by the OSL, such as NotBarraLibreCamp

=item Members of the Madrid.pm and Barcelona.pm

=item Volunteers and other L<people attached to the
L<OSL|http://osl.ugr.es/about/quienes-somos/>

=item Additional help from the L<IT delegation of the university of
Granada|http://detic.ugr.es> and L<Computer Science
School|http://etsiit.ugr.es>

=head3 Contact

We will setup an address @ugr.es, but for the time being the contact
will be L<dirosl@ugr.es> (direction of the Free Software office)

=head2 Venue

We will hold it at the most convenient place at the L<University of
Granada|http://www.ugr.es>, with campus all over the city of Granada
(Spain). Granada includes such beauties as the Alhambra and the most
    beautiful grafittis of all the country. 

We have pre-acceptance for holding it at the
    L<ETSIIT|http://etsiit.ugr.es> Computer Science School, which is
    in the outskirts of the city but has all the facilities needed for
    a multi-room conference and is, anyways, well communicated with
    the rest of the city.

Granada is linked to Madrid, London and Barcelona by regular daily and
frequent flights and also to Mallorca and to other places (but flight
frequencies vary often). Málaga is one hour away by car or 2 hours by
bus and is linked to all major European cities. There are buses and
trains to Madrid and Seville, but coach is always the best option
outside the plane. 

The ETSIIT is linked to the city center (with many lodging options) by
several buses. Depending on the date, student residences might also be
available (July is the best date for that, since usual guests will be
on holiday).


=head3 Catering

The school has a relatively large cafeteria and a university mensa,
which can accomodate a good amount of hungry students. There are 250
sitting places, but buffer-style eating with sitting space outside the
cafeteria, including common areas and classes, can also be
arranged. The school cafeteria can provide the food itself for a good
price (from 17€ a sitting, served menu to less if it's standing around
tables).

Cheap beer-and tapas can be had around the school for 2€ beer + tapa
of choice, 4 beers (or non-alcoholic drinks) are enough for any hungry
monger. 

=head2 Conference details

It's going to be, AFAIK, the southernmost conference, so this has
going to have nothing to do with the conference itself.

=head3 Date

Due to budgetary reasons, the university is locked during August;
closest we can make it is late July or early September. Late July has
the advantage of empty classrooms with no problem to schedule the
conference, while early September would be a little more problematic
(but no big deal for a 2 or 3 day conference), milder weather (but you
							       can
							       still
							       go to
							       the
							       beach)
    and good choice of accomodations (lower touristic season, if
				      there's such a thing in
Granada).

=head3 Theme

We propose I<The art of Perl> as a theme for this conference. Perl
poetry has been all but forgotten, and, besides, the Fine Arts school
is close to the Computer Science school, so we might even attract some
of those free spirits to our conference.
