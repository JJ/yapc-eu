 The L<OSL (Free Software Offfice)|http://osl.ugr.es> is led by L<JJ
 Merelo|http://search.cpan.org/~jmerelo/>, with a longtime Perl
 experience, founder of the mainly course-oriented Granada.pm (which
 organizes virtual courses of L<basic Perl|http://cevug.ugr.es/perl>
 and L<intermediate Perl| http://cevug.ugr.es/perl_avanzado> with a
 long history and more than a dozen editions. Merelo has attended, and
 made presentations, at the YAPC::EU 2002 and 2009 conferences, and
 also attended and presented a paper at the 2013 FOSDEM Perl Devroom.

 The OSL will have the support of the two strongest Perl Mongers group
 in the Spanish state, Madrid.pm and Barcelona.pm, who will help with
 anything that is not quintessentially local.
