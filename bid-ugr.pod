    =head1 University of Granada proposal for YAPC::EU 2014


=head2  University of Granada proposal for YAPC::EU 2014

The Free Software Office at the L<University of
Granada|http://www.ugr.es>, with the support of Madrid.pm and
Barcelona.pm presents this bid for YAPC::EU 2014.

=head3 Organizers

 The L<OSL (Free Software Offfice)|http://osl.ugr.es> is led by L<JJ
 Merelo|http://search.cpan.org/~jmerelo/>, with a longtime Perl
 experience, founder of the mainly course-oriented Granada.pm (which
 organizes virtual courses of L<basic Perl|http://cevug.ugr.es/perl>
 and L<intermediate Perl| http://cevug.ugr.es/perl_avanzado> with a
 long history and more than a dozen editions. Merelo has attended, and
 made presentations, at the YAPC::EU 2002 and 2009 conferences, and
 also attended and presented a paper at the 2013 FOSDEM Perl Devroom.

 The OSL will have the support of the two strongest Perl Mongers group
 in the Spanish state, Madrid.pm and Barcelona.pm, who will help with
 anything that is not quintessentially local.

 The key persons of the proposal would be:

=over 1

=item JJ Merelo, with experience organizing other events such as PPSN
2002 and ECAL 1995, in the evolutionary algorithm area. Also
collaboration with other conferences such as CEC 2011 or EvoStar, and
many events by the OSL, such as NotBarraLibreCamp

=item Members of the Madrid.pm and Barcelona.pm

=item Volunteers and other L<people attached to the
L<OSL|http://osl.ugr.es/about/quienes-somos/>

=item Additional help from the L<IT delegation of the university of
Granada|http://detic.ugr.es> and L<Computer Science
School|http://etsiit.ugr.es>

=head3 Contact

We will setup an address @ugr.es, but for the time being the contact
will be L<dirosl@ugr.es> (direction of the Free Software office)

=head2 Venue

We will hold it at the most convenient place at the L<University of
Granada|http://www.ugr.es>, with campus all over the city of Granada
(Spain). Granada includes such beauties as the Alhambra and the most
    beautiful grafittis of all the country. 

We have pre-acceptance for holding it at the
    L<ETSIIT|http://etsiit.ugr.es> Computer Science School, which is
    in the outskirts of the city but has all the facilities needed for
    a multi-room conference and is, anyways, well communicated with
    the rest of the city.
